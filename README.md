## Overview

This project implements a CNN-based model for classifying brain tumor images from MRI scans into two categories: benign and malignant. The model uses a deep learning approach to automatically detect and classify the presence of a tumor, aiming to assist in medical diagnostics and treatment planning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for developing the machine learning model.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Frameworks for implementing the CNN model and training the neural network.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Libraries for numerical operations and data handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For data analysis, model development, and documentation.
